# Traffic Sign Detection


Developed a Traffic Sign Detection system that identifies traffic signs from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Collected and preprocessed a dataset of multiple traffic sign classes, trained a deep learning model achieving high accuracy and demonstrated predictions on new images.
